# SimpleTerm
SimpleTerm is a python class to simulate terminal-like interface. 
One can subclass TalkTerm to create a personalized interface.

To test TalkTerm, you can run it without any argument by 

	python talkterm.py 

In such a case, a TalkTerm class is created
and its "run" method is called. If everything correct, you will see something like
